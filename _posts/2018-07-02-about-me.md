I am currently a penultimate year electrical and electronic engineering student in Imperial College London. Throughout my three years in university, I have developed an interest in software development and machine learning. My most recent project was a collaboration with Microsoft to build a Visual Studio Code extension geared towards data scientists that provides notebook-like functionalities within the code editor itself. 

In my free time, I like to read about history and have recently developed an interest in sociology and psychology. I also enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee.
