I am a recent electrical and electronic engineering graduate from Imperial College London. Throughout my four years in university, I have developed an interest in software development. One of my recent collaborations was a project with Microsoft to build a Visual Studio Code extension geared towards data scientists that provides notebook-like functionalities within the code editor itself. 

In my free time, I like to read about history and have recently become fascinated with sociology and psychology. I also enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee.
